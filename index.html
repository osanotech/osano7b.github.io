  I know it's been a while....
 <br>
 Sorry I have been mastering linux and furthering my knowledge on more programming aspects!
 <br />
How many people on sololearn prefer linux over windows...? I know I do! I also have been designing Sites for a  few companies , attempting to establish a suitable repatation for myself in the web development business! I am going to be back on sololearn alot more again now that i finished up all my projects....
</br>

I am looking forward also to see what you all have been up to as far as projects, and I am excited to pound on my keyboard again and get some new projects up! Anyone just love the sounds the keys make on the keyboard when writing code, watching line after line form on the screen...?
 


<br>
PS: I viewed this blog page on a few other devices, YIKES! I got some major adjusting to do lol....need to add some more <b>RWD</b>!

 Hey Coders! 
 <br>
 
 
 Sorry I have not blogged in a while, Been extermely busy the past month! We recently picked up a new programmer for codeminded, so we have been getting alot of work done this past month. Also I got a new job working in a tech shop so I could have money to help sponser our team and get our projects live on the internet! Ill be blogging a little more now! I also have been keeping my sololearn updated with a few little projects here and there! Hoping to give the world something really great soon, but I am off to bed! I just wrote 3500 lines of code, Me and Joe (the new team member) have ben working on an awesome new project! 
<br><br>
 This was my first day at work! Loved it!!!!

So last night I attended a "code off" event
in which me and about 50 other programmers competed in writting code for web developement!! <br />
I was there with my laptop writting code for 17 hours straight!!!!  <br />
I actually wrote my previous blog / post 65...while I was there. I got to show off a lot of my work ....I showed alot of my sololearn projects. It was fun, but also exhausting!!!!! This was me about 12 hours into coding taking my first break!!!

Good Evening programmers! <br>
I am adding more and more to the blog page on a weekly basis, Hope you all
Enjoy all the new features! The CodeMinded website is about 90% done, just 
Working out some php and it will be live before the end of June! I wanted to say
as well that I have this blog hooked up with google analytics just for fun, and
I really appreciate everyone that visits my blog, I do monitor it and its very interesting!
I get to see what countries your visiting from, what devices and os you use, browsers, how long
You’re on the page and how many times you visit! I was actually surprised to see people
Spend anywhere from 10-25 mins on my blog! Thanks guys! Makes me want to keep 
Updating the page for you (=

What’s going on programmers?  It’s a beautiful day here in Massachusetts and I feel very creative today…. thinking of something fun but useful for the world of tech to whip up!!!! I got some pretty bad feedback on my <b>VERY FIRST JAVA PROGRAM</b> I have ever written in my life, people insinuating that it wasn’t my most auspicious work, but that’s ok, ill get better at it! <br />
Anyways, let’s get creative, I am open to work with anyone who has something, lets exchange some ideas and work together, me and my team CodeMinded &trade; are always looking to grow and have some new brilliant intellect brought to the table!  
<br>
Contact me via facebook or email, lets chat, we can work remotely and share some success!
Have a great day everyone! <br>

Took a little while but…

<p>
I finally wrote my first java program here on solo learn! Nothing to complex but I am proud of it!!! It’s a simple get Ip Address program for your device, now that I am learning the ways of java I will be unleashing at lot more as I go!!! Down below I inserted a link to the page for you guys to check it out  if you’d like to. Its nothing crazy with color schemes and tons of detail added like I usually do , But I enjoyed learning and writing it!!!

Blog was down for a few days....
</b> </center>
<p>
So sorry everyone, I had to take the blog down to add a few more things! I did not want people to try to look at it publicly while I was working on it! But I added a side nav feature with a few of my projects, I will add more periodically. Also I have a few more tricks up my sleeve, I have a CodeMinded Home page on its way!!! Super excited to release it to the world!!! Also I was going through a few changes with my team, we lost one of our programmers, who also was my C.O.O but, oh well….. <br>
Anyways, We have been working really on hard over here at CodeMinded , day and night on multiple projects! Plus I have a few more features that I do want to add to this blog page! <br> I have also been teaching a few new aspects to the company the tricks and trades of code writing and programming!
<br>
Well I hope you all enjoy the new feature on my blog, trying to make navigation more of <i>”Smooth Sailing”</i> experience! As always I am open to any and all suggestions from my fellow programmers! <br>

Thanks for the support & love everyone!!!!! <br><br>

<b> So heres the deal...</b> </center>
<p>
 
 I am not usually for this whole drama ordeal, but someone on sololearn is trying to call me out!!! <br>
 So there's a user on here and his username is uid, he commented on one of my sololearn projects insinuating that i stole one of his ideas or something....? So I looked at his page and believe it or not he has the same project. Funny right!!!!
 <br> The project is my <a href="https://code.sololearn.com/WHw732QUkHlY/#html" style="text-decoration: none;">Social Login Page</a> , he took the project, added his own css to it and now is claiming its his!!! Now the only difference is...his was posted almost 4 days ago.... MIne was posted over 11 days ago....Sooooo I am assuming most of us here know how to do basic math! <br>
 Now let's look at another aspect of the situation! Look at all my projects, and look at all his...lol...I mean really? HIs level of programming skill could not match mine if you compared his best to my worse!!! <br> If you are looking for someone to battle with buddy, you picked the wrong guy!!! I do not just write website’s i have many other projects I do not put on sl because of its complexity!!! I have  team of programmers that i run and we are kicking off a tech company, doing big things for the world of technology!!! <br> I put my life on it that in matter of time in which you write 100 lines of some basic html and css (that you probably stole) Ill have a 100 lines to math each 1 line that you wrote!!! <br>
Not just html either, Im talking JavaScript, PhP, C#....I have an artificial assistant (Jarvis) that controls my whole house (including all my tech, security etc..). <br> Trust me you little bottom feeder your <i>”skills”</i> could not compete with mine on any given day!!! <br>
Go ahead programmers, Go look at his page and you be the judge, Who has better work, Me or uid????

<b> I want to brush up on Js and Jquery....</b> </center>
<p>


I Have been snooping around and see that a few of you use Jquery inside your development!
I want to start dabbling into it and see what new ideas come about! It seems very similar to Javascript! So it should not be so hard to figure out….are the one and the same thing...i know when i did my research it stated the jquery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. So anyone have anything on this...should i stick with just JavaScript ...Jquery ...or both? If you want to respond to me on this just hash tag the post number in the comments section and let me know what you think. THanks guys <br>
And as always……
<p>
    
    Oh! Btw! I dropped my about me page today!!!! Its Live on sololearn as we speak <br>

I have been getting alot of good comments and upvotes, all around great feedback from you guys!!!! I love it! I have also been looking at a lot of projects here on sololearn from the people I follow or follow me! I have to say I am amazed by the talent and creativeness us programmers have! A Lot of you are so talented, it inspires me to want to do better! Thank you for that! <br>
I know i have only been uploading simple things like blogs, login pages, register pages but, I do have a lot coming and cant wait untill me and my team {CodeMinded &copy;} have been working day and night on. We will continue to put out more and more pages here on sololearn and eventually we will have a live page for the wolrd to be able to connect to and see everything we flood the internet with! With that being said I have to get back to work! Just dropped in for a update! Continue to be excellent programmers! <br>

This is actually one of my good friends that i use to program with on a daily basis , he took a small hiatus from programming but got back into the groove of it again recently! He is learning some basics in html and css right now but give him some time and he will be on another level of excellence!!!!!!! Please go follow him for me please and show our fellow coder some support!!! 
He is somewhat new to sololearn as well so lets get him some upvotes and show him the ropes!
Down below is a link to his page, click away and show some love, thanks coders!!!!!!!!

<b> For the new page!  </b> </center>
<p>
Hello World! So as you all know I have been working on this project i have for a while now. I have been promising to show  something from the page I am creating! So at the end of this blog is a  link to the page, its not viewing correctly on mobile devices yet, so if you view it on your laptop or desktop it will look better! Anyways, not every detail is on the page I would like to keep it a complete surprise! But I am always open to your opinions! This page that I am making is going to be great! Anyways leave me some feedback on it, Upvote it and let me know if you  think I should change anything about it! Please keep in mind it does look better in web browser view there is only so much i can do with sololearn! Thanks guys and as always <br>

Do more of you use sololearn via pc or mobile device?? I continue to update my page and test out my new changes on my phone to make sure everything looks good!
Anyways! Anybody watching the live stream of mark zuckerberg with congress? I am watching it, I kind of feel bad for the guy. I mean i respect programmers and the whole world of tech, I live by it so it is sad to see someone who worked so hard have to go through this. The whole cambridge analytica is horrible I will say but mark zuckerberg has created something that literally connects the whole world together, and even though the accusations say he “stole the idea” still, when he launched facebook he did that from scratch, from the bottom of the barrell and turned it into the largest social media site in the world. Us as programmers have to respect that!

<b>  With just a few glitches </b> </center>
<p>
So i got the new feature added! I added a Javascript content search bar for the page! But, as you can see there are some minor yet seemingly annoying problems with it! First things first i cant get the <em>”text word</em> in the search box to go away! I usually use placeholder for a feature such as this but javascript is a pain in the….yeah! Another thing is when searching for a certain word or any other content on the page, once it starts getting to words further from the top the box stays at the top, so it makes it utterly annoying to continue to search for things when you have to keep going back up!!!!!!! <b>IMPOSSIBLE</b> I swear I have a love hate relationship with javascript!!! Anyways I Have been Writing code for about 10 hours straight and its midnight, so time for this coder to get some shut eye! Maybe it will come to me while I am passed out. As always I am open to suggestions, comments, thoughts, Brilliance ….whatever you guys have to offer I am completely open to it. Sorry its not completely done guys…..back at it tomorrow.

A Lot of individuals have been sending me Emails and leaving comments , hurling accusations at me that I am not a programmer because a lot of what i publish here on sololearn is <em>html & css</em>!!! <br>
Well just so you know i code a lot in PhP and JavaScript! Also my first ever learned language was C# and I am currently in the midst of studying Java!! Here’s the thing….a lot of the projects I <b>”</b>Code<b>”</b> are just to much for the servers and site of sololearn! With that being said here is a small project i have written about 5 months back including a small amount of javascript!!!! New Feature coming soon!!!!

<b> Needs an idea  </b> </center>
<p>

It is a rainy, dark and breezy night where I am, My laptop is open and I am filled with inspiration. I just am having a creative block right now! I despise when this happens! 
So , As usual , I am reaching out to my fellow programmers…...HELP! <br>
I don't know what to create, I got a pizza on the way. Food for thought…? 
Also I would want to create something that i can share via sololearn, but….They limit me as to what i can put on here! 


<br> 
<div class="time"> 09:28:21 PM</div>


<br><p>
Anyone else watch programming movies or shows to get some aspiration? I am currently watching silicon valley, It's a show partially inspired by co-creator Mike Judge's experiences as a Silicon Valley engineer in the 1980s! Its pretty good!  I am currently watching this hoping an idea sparks in my head but my brain is like a wet match right now.

<b>Got a new idea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b> </center>
<p>
    So i made this page called <i>”Code of the week”</i> , Every week i will post a new code to this page that i find intriguing. The page is already made and i attached a login page to it. Now the codes that i post may not be the most complex codes ever, but more or less something that just sparked my interests. Also if anyone wants me to post one of your codes go ahead and let me know, i will put your name and a link to your sololearn page on it making sure you get all the credit. I think should be a good way for some people to get some notoriety on their projects!!
Hope you all enjoy and here you go!! <br>

<b>Check out the new page I created!!!!</b> <br>I made a new page <em>(url below)</em></center>

<p>
Wrote the code for it in about 20 mins. Its basically like a ad or a flyer if you will. Check it out,
Upvote it please, Like some feedback in the comments section….I love hearing feedback from my fellow programmers. I been working day and night and i know i said i would have something by the end of the week. Its nothing to special but still something. You know me I love making new blog pages and about me pages. I wish i could connect this site to php so i could have feedback comments and likes directly on this page! But oh well…have a great day coders, more to come soon!

<b>  People who develop sites with wordpress are not programmers!!!!!!! They are designers!!!! </b> </center>
<p>


Sorry if that comes off as blunt or mean but its the truth! Its like comparing someone who builds houses to someone who plays with LEGOS!!!! I looked into wordpress before i contemplated writing this blog, its for people that do not and can not write code but need websites done! Now if you are not a web developer or programmer and need to have your business online, i see nothing wrong with it! But i came across someone on facebook who published a page and advertised it in some programming page (might have even been sololearn page via fb) saying <em>”oh look at my new page i developed “</em>.....The page had a very nice layout and was well organized!! So me being me i like to give credit where credit is due and so here i am scrolling through the comments section on his post to see he used wordpress to design the page….LAME!!!! I take to much pride in being a programmer and have a work ethic that rivalled the  Amish! So no, If you use wordpress you get no points in my book!!! <br />
Shout out tothe real programmers!

<b>It's been a month since i last posted a blog!!!!! Sorry for the delay!!!!!!</b> </center>
<p>
Sorry, I have been writing tons and tons of code over the past month or so!!! <i>Honestly</i> If i uploaded everything i have been working on in these last few weeks it would probably FLOOD Sololearns Servers lol!!! I have about 28 Different PhP Scripts i wrote, Well over 100 new html codes (nevermind all the css that it contains), and also i have been working with
PhP - MySql Databases a lot. One Project i Made i Cant upLoad to SL because of its connection with MySql (sololearn don't support it) - But it is my own personal People Database of everyone i know. It contains a login page that only i have credentials and access to. Eventually I am going to hook it up with “Jarvis”  System that runs all my tech and my house (Via C#) so i can have him look people up for me. For Example, “Jarvis pull up moms info” And he will then pull up a page i have created with all of my mothers information that i need. It contains “Name” , “Email”, “Phone number”, “Address”, “Nicknames” , “Date of BIrth” and much much more. It's actually pretty intriguing!!! Anyways I am going to upload some of the more simpler projects i have been working on to sololearn , It Can't really handle the more extreme projects which is kind of lame! But it's ok one of my projects is “Dave's World” and once it goes live everyone will be able to catch everything that i am doing first hand, including blogs, video tutorials on projects i have accomplished, Live Coding, Live chat and so Much more. It just has to be perfect before i release it to the world! (= <br>
Anyways that's all for now programmers, Sorry for going mia on you! I will upload something by the end of the week and post it on my blog !!!!!! <em>”Re-Code The world”</em><em>”Hack The world”</em>

Come on now! Anyways, I am thinking of making a new blog, a <q>PHP Blog</q> Just because i like making blogs so i want to dabble into the blog world a bit and further my knowledge on php at the same time. Dont worry ill keep this blog still lol. But maybe, just maybe ill intertwine this html blog with the php blog and make it 100x better! 
    <br>
    Btw i keep making small changes and not updating the entire blog with it so i can see the progression i have made

<b>Warning!!! This is not be tried at home!!!</b><BR>
    OK So Im feeling pretty mischievous tonight! I got this kid that wont stop bothering my little sister, so instead of 
    going to his house and...well you know, catching a charge or something i am going to have to handle it in the cyber world!
    Yes this means exactly what you think it means!!! TIme to put on my black hat! Time to have some fun with this, alls i have to do is get my ducks in order...ready....here we go!
    </p>
    
    <div class="time">11:10 pm</div>
    <p style="color:rgba(29,249,68,1.00)">
        <b>STEP ONE:</b><br>
        Ok so first things first i have to get this jerks basic information, you know, first and last name, e-mail and interests! Thanks to facebook that should be pretty easy!
        </p>
        
          <div class="time">11:18 pm</div>
    <p style="color:rgba(29,249,68,1.00)">
        <b>STEP TWO:</b><br>
          Easy, Now that i have acquired all that i found out this guy is a huge dog lover and owns 2 of his own pitbulls. OK Say nomore , so now I am going to brew up a quick and simple html page(ie fake page)!! Kids stuff!! 
          </p>
          
                  <div class="time">11:38 pm</div>
    <p style="color:rgba(29,249,68,1.00)"> 
     <b>STEP THREE: </b><br>
       so i cooked up a html page that consists of "deals" for this moron and his dogs lol. I made it look as if he can get deals like "buy 4 pounds of dog food (for specific price) and get 5 pounds of dog for free" / "Purchase a leather leash for (specific price) and get (specific item) for free" and etc....<br>
       The page is real simple but looks pretty official! 
    
    </p>


<div class="time">11:43 pm</div>
<p style="color:rgba(29,249,68,1.00)"> 
    <b>STEP FOUR:</b><br>
          Now i add the credit card form that i have posted here on sololearn in my code projects to the "doglovers site"!!!
          Also i have to insert my php action script that i have shared in a previous posts to the html file, linking it with .txt file to save all the details in text format! Piece of cake!
          </p>
          
          

<div class="time">11:45 pm</div>
<p style="color:rgba(29,249,68,1.00)"> 
<b>STEP FIVE:</b><br>
I have to make sure that my ip adress is completely camouflaged , which i have software for or, i can just send this page via tor browser which will mask the ip for me and destroy all traces and web browser history with the click of one button, yeah i think i like that option best! Moving right along.


</p>


<div class="time">11:50 pm</div>
<p style="color:rgba(29,249,68,1.00)"> 
<b>STEP SIX:</b><br>
I have come across a few free web hosting servers via google search within seconds! They are making this way to easy! <br>
currently adding my 3 files to same directory (XAMPP HtDocs). Once the page finishes loading to the web, i get a direct link to my own "fake page" and now i send it to this moron and wait for him to do what he does best, Prove his stupidity!!!! 
Goodluck Buddy!!!! Now i just play the waiting game!<br>

 <B>FEELING EXTREMELY LIVID WITH A VEXED CODE ISSUE!!!!!!!!!</B><br>
 I  just sat here for 2 and a half hours adjusting and adding code to this blog ok? It came out beautiful while i was doing it on my laptop, i would run it in browser - lovely! I would run it on my laptop via sololearn - lovely!
 So basically what i did was add a picture of myself to on the side of each "blog post" !!! Came out soooo good, after hours of height and width adjustment and playing with "margin-left" "margin-bottom" , all that fun stuff i finally had it how i wanted it! I felt a sense of accomplishment as  i usually do while writting code! 
 Then, the final test after i updated the code in Sololearn for you guys to admire and love lol, i pull up my sololearn app on my phone. Now like i was saying this is always my final test when adding updates, on the sl app on the phone the picture was over lapping the time and date and the "Post #" and a bunch of things just looked out of whack!!!!! I couldnt even believe it ! Now i could have went in and did some adjusting but then it would have looked different for those who would view it on their laptops or desktops. So!! I figured the majority of us are probably using sololearn via phone so i left it alone! };

    Ever have one of them days? Where you feel like you can be super creative with your programming skills, yet you are just having a sort of <em>"writters block"</em>!!!! I have literally been sitting here attempting to make a <b>SIMPLE</b> but nice image gallery for someone and nothing seems to go accordingly! Complete and uter annoyance!
     All the images come out sized differently, yet i have the width and size of them all set the same. Some images load upside down or sideways when putting them in via img src. I have them all in the same div class with a hover feature and only a set few ACTUALLY hover when dragging the mouse across it!!!! Errrrrr...... 
     <br>
     My exasperation level is through the roof right now!!!!!!! So, with that being said (i hate to be a quitter) I think i am calling it quits for the night! Ill get a good nights rest and come back to it tomorrow! If anyone has any suggestions on making a decent image gallery or why my images upload upside down , please feel free to comment on this and let know!! Other wise ill just research it when i wake up!!!!!

    So its past one in the morning where i am and i have ben writing code, pounding at my laptops keyboard for nearly 9 hours now! Been learning alot and working on an awesome new website. I am not going to share it quite yet , seeing as how i have not perfected it and got everything set up exactly the way i perfer it! I want this to be daunting when i show it to the world - I want it to be awe-inspiring, striking, stunning, breathtaking, all of the above!!!! To tell you all the truth i have various projects that i am working on!!!!
    Three for myself, one of for my mother and one for a buddy of mines business! I am trying to keep busy and be able to master this art and be a programming specialist!
    
    
</p>
<div class="time">1:44 am</div>

<p>
    Part of me wants to go to bed so that i am not up untill 7 am writing code and getting sloppy with my projects, but theres another part of me (like 98% of me) that just wants to stay up and go on a 5 day coding tear lol!!!! I keep telling myself "okay only add a few more lines of code to the site then be done", but that turns into a few hundred more lines of code and another few hours or so gone!!!!!
    
    
</p>
<div class="time">1:53 am</div>

<p>
    
    I think i need to google, find and attend "p/a".....Programmers anonymous!!!!!
    I am seriously addicted to this, it consumes almost all my free time!!! (=
    
</p>

<div class="time">1:59 am</div>
<p>
    Does anyone else think that a photo background on the body of the webpage looks a bit <i>tacky</i>? Or is it just me??? I sometimes find it to be unimaginative, i feel like anyone can go on google find a monotonous image of code and apply to their body to make it seem like they accomplished anything more then a simple css line of code.
    
</p>

<div class="time">2:39 am</div>
<p> Completely random, but i decided to take a break for a few mins and was surfing the web! I stumbled across an article that was very intriguing!! The article caught my attention because i saw a headline that i could relate to in every way... it said <strong>"Intelligent people tend to be messy, stay awake longer, and swear more"</strong>! 
     Now i dont know about you guys but i am up at all hours of the night (clearly as i am blogging past 2 am), Not going to lie i swear a little on the heavy side, and i wouldnt say that i am a slob, but i absolutely have a lot of stuff everywhere!!! My RoomMate is constantly telling me to organize my stuff in a better manner. But i like it my way lol.
    
    
</p>

<div class="time">2:43 am</div>
<p>
    Incase anyone wants to read this article heres the link.
    <a href="http://nordic.businessinsider.com/intelligent-people-tend-to-be-messy-stay-awake-longer-and-swear-more-2016-10/">Intelligent people url</a>. I honestly liked the section that states <i>"Were you annoyed as a kid, when your parents told you to clean your room, sent you to bed early and scolded you for cursing? There might be a reason for your behaviour, Studies suggest, that it can be linked to an increase of your IQ."
    
   
</i>
    That was me to the tee!!!!! 
    
</p>

<div class="time">3:15 am</div>
<p>
  So, i finally put my laptop away!!! Currently blogging via phone. But!!! I do have all my art supplies out (markers, ruler,pencils)  and my sketch pad. Im going to finish drawing up some ideas for my projects. Yes i like to draw them out and design them on paper first so im not just spit balling while writing the code. This way i have my blue prints infront of me , i wire in and get it done. It helps to be more creative when i can envision what i am doing!!! 
  
    <b>visualization is key for me!!!!!
    </b>
    <br>
    But thats going to be it for me tonight (i hope) goodnight programmers.

    i have everything set up in my css correctly, i dont get it...? Im going to keep working on it and see what happens.

    I am like 99% sure google has updated their security by now so i dont think sharing this should be an issue, seeing as how its not even the whole script and is outdated. (=

    Awesome, So i have a new project at hand! My mother owns a business and wants me to design the website for her! I am pretty excited to do so because everything that i code is just stuff for me. So i feel like this will have more meaning and i'll put more effort into it. Sweet, I am going to be seeing her tomorrow and get the basics of what she wants on the page and then its time to get down to business. I cant wait to get this accomplished, I never hosted a website before but Im sure its not to complicated. I have looked into 
<a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">www.godaddy.com</a> and also <a href="https://www.networksolutions.com/">www.networksolutions.com</a> and it seems pretty clear cut! 
</p>
<div class="time">8:56 pm</div>
<p>
   Anyways so thats what ill be <i><em><b>Wired into</b></em></i> for the next 2 weeks or so! Maybe even longer who knows.I think i might even start the basics of it tonight and get as much done as possible until i hit the point of neededing information from her! I know there will have to be a gallery for all her stuff she sells, contact information section and probably some of the color pink in there lol.

    I have ben non-stop writting code for like 6 hours straight!!!!!!!! I absolutely love this, it brings me into a whole other relm, my great escape. I added a few new things to the blog page today, even a little javascript! I am still wondering about connecting sololearn pages to myphp admin and Mysql. That would allow me to do so much more adding a bunch of new functions! Maybe once i finish adding everything i want and have it entirely how i want i can publish it and make it an <i><b>&quot; Offical Webpage&quot;</b></i> and add PHP to it and some more Js! </p>
    <p>
    Anyways, today was a very prosperous day in my small world of programming! I achieved alot of new knowledge on the way and now i think i am going to look into this linking php with sololearn mission! Wish me luck....

    So I am contemplating adding a "search" feature to this blog page so that "keywords" and specific posts can be searched for via PHP. So my question is....Would i be able to connect this blog page to PHPMyAdmin and MySql Database via sololearn. I mean I am going to try regardless but if someone already has the answer to this inquiry then it would save me alot of time and possibly alot of frustration!!
    If someone has the answer to this question please just throw it in the comments section for me, it mean a great deal, thanks programmers!

<p>Havent posted in a few days, been hitting the PHP studies pretty hard! Also i have been brushing up on some physics books seeing as how ill be in school again in a few months. Not really to much to say tonight ... been 
doing alot of challenge courses with alot of you, half time i lose lol but its all a learning expeirence. The million dollar idea still has not hit me for an app or website. Maybe i should just look into some kind of career in web devolpment..?  
Anyways.... Once i get more of grasp on php i plan on getting back to writting <em>code</em>. I just want to make sure i am as good @ php as i am with html and css.

<p>so i finally started exploring 
in the php language, not going to lie i was pretty intimidated by it for a while. I took the test course here on sololearn about a month back and passed but ever since then i kinda put it on the back burner! So i started exploring it today, worked on the variables , strings and functions part .... grasped it pretty quickly!!!! Im excited to be able to start adding it to my web projects and seeing my pages be more functionable. 
</p>


<div class="time">10:00 pm</div>
<P>
  so i added a small but useful feature to the blog...if you scroll down to the bottom of the page, i added a "back to top" option. Save you and me some scrolling time , nothing to serious but useful.
    
</P>

<p> Trying to come up with a idea! I am sitting here, laptop running, phone running , surfing the web hoping a great idea hits me and everytime something sparks it has already been done! I think ill just keep making minor adjustments to the <strong>blog</strong> and throwing out some little simple projects to keep myself busy, Advancing in web development! I think i got something i want to add to this blog page right now, just wondering exactly where i want it...

 <div class="time">12:04 am</div>
 
 <p> Well i made some progress today, successfully accessed the <i>"Dark Webb"</i>, I worked on this blog<i>(minor details)</i> and i started another project!
   Hopefully tomorrow i have some more creative ideas and can come up something a little more challenging then accessing something that was supposed to be close to unattainable to get to. Maybe Im just getting better at this, ill run with thought to end the night (=

<p>Ok, So i got tor browser up and running, made sure my security settings were set to my standards!!!! while browsing via tor browser i came across a link called "hiddenwiki". On this wiki is a url that seems like a good starting point...Lets browse!!!  </p>

<div class="time">5:28 pm</div>
<p> There are so many options on this wiki its crazy! The things they have on here...Hmm this seemed a little to easy?   </p>


<div class="time">5:30 pm</div>
<p>I found a webpage that is title <i>"uk guns and ammo store"</i> lol. This is actually pretty interesting, i wonder what else i can come across on here....?</p>


<div class="time">5:49 pm</div>
<p>Its pretty cool you can reset your identity on tor browser at any given time if you feel unsafe or hacked!!! Anyone else interested in exploring this??? Shoot me a E-mail and ill send you the link directly -->>>>  <a href="mailto:davidchamp0101@gmail.com">E-mail link </a> </p>


<div class="time">7:08 pm</div>

<p>well that was fun while it lasted,I dont really see what all the hype is about but it could come in handy down the road.</p>

<p>So as im skimming threw some of the projects on here i was very upset to see some people have no creativity and lack originality! Every single blog page i looked at was the basic template blog form provided by sololearn. Basically just modified a few details threw their name on the header and called it a day. smh so sad. When i get back to my house and get infront of my laptop ill be adding more features ...well at least one new feature of code to this site</p>
<div class="time">3:16 pm</div>
<p>Im kind of in the mood for some mischief activity right about now!!!! I kinda want to do some hacking!!!!
hmmm...i just need an idea...better yet a mission of some sort...maybe i should surf the web and see if i come across sommething....? Maybe try to access the <strong>DARK WEB</strong>???? </p>

<P>I think that sounds like a good idea, i already have tor browser on my laptop, Im sure its much easier then people assume, but more complicated then the movies...</P>

<p>Having such a hard time trying to create a simple profile picture onto a about me page via sololearn. I wish they would just let you upload images from
your computer instead of having to do it from  a webpage. I hate when the most simpliest tasks in programing vex me to the pont of no return. Anyone else having difficulties with this???  </p>

<p><strong>SORRY!!!!!!!!!!</strong>Did Not mean to put fowl words in my blog! I forgot there are people of all ages in here and I am not looking to get banned! So this is my public apology for that.Sometimes when your typing away you get caught up in your own thoughts and let everything just flow out! Thanks for the correction John Wells </p>

<p>I apologize to anyone i may have offended, However I am glad my blog is getting notoriety (=</p>

<p><strong>Changed up the look!!</strong>It used to be just gray and white, simple but boring so i switched it up. Also i got rid of the live js time and date, it was kind of a eye sore! Plus i have the time and date posted on every blog that im  posting so there was no need for it! Hmmmm....what else to add??? Feel free to throw some suggestions on the comment section. </p>

<p>I really cant seem to get the system time of windows to sync with my c# code. There has to be a way to do it if you can create and sync time with javascript. I found a few different examples on google but it dont look to accurate. Plus it does not show how switch from a.m to p.m, which i really only need a.m for jarvis to wake me up in the morning.
</p>

<p>
if (System.DateTime.Now.Hour >= 9) 
{ 

say("good morning");
say("the time is now 9 o clock");

}
